\usage{
get_ddr_data(date, asset_class = NULL, curate = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{date}{the date for which data is required as Date or DateTime object.
Only the year, month and day elements of the object are used and it must of
be length one.}

\item{asset_class}{the asset class for which you would like to download trade
data. Valid inputs are \code{"CR"} (credit), \code{"IR"} (rates),
\code{"EQ"} (equities), \code{"FX"} (foreign exchange), \code{"CO"}
(commodities). Can be a vector of these. Defaults to \code{NULL} which
corresponds to all asset classes.}

\item{curate}{a logical flag indicating whether raw data should be returned
or whether the raw data should be processed (default). The latter involves
selecting particular fields and formatting these as seemed appropriate
based on data reviews at the time the formatting was coded.}
}

  on that date, an empty data frame (zero columns and rows) is returned.
