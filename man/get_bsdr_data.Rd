\title{Get Bloomberg SDR data}
\usage{
get_bsdr_data(date, asset_class = NULL, curate = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{date}{the date for which data is required as Date or DateTime object.
It will use all date-time elements including year, month, day, hour,
minute, second (incl. fractional seconds) and  time zone information to
determine the set of trades to return. It will return the set of trades
for the day starting on \code{date}.}

\item{asset_class}{the asset class for which you would like to download
trade data. Valid inputs are \code{"CR"} (credit), \code{"IR"} (rates),
\code{"EQ"} (equities), \code{"FX"} (foreign exchange), \code{"CO"}
(commodities). Can be a vector of these. Defaults to \code{NULL} which
corresponds to all asset classes.}

\item{curate}{a logical flag indicating whether raw data should be returned
or whether the raw data should be processed (default). The latter involves
selecting particular fields and formatting these as seemed appropriate
based on data and API reviews at the time the formatting was coded.}
}
\value{
a data frame containing the requested data, or an empty data frame
  if data is unavailable
}
\description{
The Bloomberg Swap Data Repository (BSDR) is a registered U.S. swap data
repository that allows market participants to fulfil their public disclosure
obligations under U.S. legislation. BSDR is required to make publicly
available price, trading volume and other trading data reported to its U.S.
repository. It publishes this data on its website in real-time and also on a
historical basis. I have reverse engineered the JavaScript libraries used by
its website to call the Bloomberg Application Service using \code{POST}
requests to a target URL.
